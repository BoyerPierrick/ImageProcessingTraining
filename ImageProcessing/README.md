# C# Console Project with OpenCV: Vector Generation and Comparison using Histograms

This project demonstrates the use of OpenCV in a C# environment for generating vectors from images and comparing these vectors using histograms. The aim is to provide a foundation for understanding how to use OpenCV in C# applications and to illustrate the concepts of vector generation and image comparison using histograms.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) to run C# applications.
- [OpenCV for C#](https://opencv.org/) which can be installed via NuGet.

## Usage
1. Make sure you have the images you want to work with in.
2. Run the project.
